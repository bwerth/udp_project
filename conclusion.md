# Conclusion

This project was largely a success, but there is room for improvement to the design in the future. I produced a 
working UDP/IP receiver and transmitter, but there were some sacrifices to functionality, reliability, and performance
in the process of achieving what I did. Moving forward, I am going to integrate an ARP table module to allow for full 
Ethernet compatibility. I will also pipeline my design for better throughput and remove up-front data aggregation as 
previously discussed.
