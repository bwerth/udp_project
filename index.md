# Introduction

In developing an understanding of the way digital and software subsystems can interact in large interdisciplinary 
designs, it is valuable to consider the application of computer communication. This is because communication is as 
simple as SPI, I2C, and UART, but can become scale to become much more complicated with protocols such as transmission
control protocol/internet protocol, which requires a software subsystem in addition to the potential inclusion of a 
digital subsystem. Over the course of this project, I intend to develop and convey an understanding of large-scale 
digital design as well as hybrid software-digital design by implementing a moderately complex Ethernet communication 
protocol, user datagram protocol/internet protocol. In doing this, I intend to convey the background information 
required to understand communications in general as well as the specific protocol I have chosen to implement.
